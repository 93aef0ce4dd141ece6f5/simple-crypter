# simple-crypter
A basic scan-time crypter using XOR encryption to obfuscate a binary.

HOW-TO:  
1. Run the crypter in crypt mode to obfuscate the binary.  
2. Run the crypter in decrypt mode to deobfuscate and execute the binary.  
3. The decrypter and binary are required to exist on the system to successfully work.  
  
Usage : ./crypt -j [JOB MODE] -f [IN FILE] -o [OUT FILE]  
  -j [JOB MODE] : Crypt/Decrypt  
  -f [IN FILE]  : File on which the job is to be done  
  -o [OUT FILE] : Output file
