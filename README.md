# simple-crypter
A basic crypter using XOR encryption to obfuscate a binary.

HOW-TO:  
1. Run the crypter in crypt mode to obfuscate the binary.  
2. Run the crypter in decrypt mode to deobfuscate and execute the binary.  
3. The decrypter and binary are required to exist on the system to successfully work.
